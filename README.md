This is an attempt at creating a simple SignalR chat demo.  The base module was created in Oqtane (6.2.1) and files/code added from the Microsoft SignalR Chat demo.  

This is currently a work in process as the chat demo does not work due to a 404 error thrown when the client module attempts to start the hub connection (/chathub).
